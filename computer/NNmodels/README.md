This directory contains all the models used for deep drive road recognition
- **DNNclassModel** -> NN with classification of the steer in N angles (with N output)
- **DNNclassFilter** ->  NN with classification of the steer in N angles + filtering such as canny filtering
- **DNNregModel** -> regression NN model with angle as output
- **CNNregModel** -> convolutionnal NN model with angle as output
- **RNNregModel** -> recursive NN model (angle at t+1 is the output)
